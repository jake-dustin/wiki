## 🌟 Overview
In order to improve security and improve collaboration in systems, all employees are required to use 1Password as their password manager.
Password Managers allow users to utilize secure passwords and share them with other users while only requiring memorization of a single password.
They also encourage and foster effective use of other security tools like SSO and passkeys.

## 👨‍🦰 Users and Roles
- All employees, regardless of their role, are required to use 1Password. 

## 📒 Policies and Guidelines
- All accounts that are accessed using a machine managed by Dustin Engineers are to be managed using 1Password.
- Employees may store personal passwords in 1Password if they wish. It's a great service and provides a lot of tools that people really should use everywhere.
### 🧙‍♂️ Master Password Guidelines
- [Tutorial from 1Password on choosing a master password](https://support.1password.com/strong-account-password/)
- The master password for the 1Password account should be secure and easy to remember but hard to guess.
  - Throwing an exclamation point on the end of a password does very little to make it more secure.
  - For tips on coming up with a secure password that meets these criteria, feel free to ask Jake.
- The master password should not be used anywhere else. It should not be written down anywhere. Commit it to memory.
  - If you are concerned about this, remember that if you use 1Password effectively, you only need to remember one password (that's where the name comes from).
### 🤝 Account Sharing
- The other major feature of a system like 1Password is that it allows users to safely and securely share login information with colleagues.
- Passwords and other sensitive information that is used by multiple users (for example, the FedEx account information) should be placed in a Shared Vault.
  - [Why and how to use vaults and share passwords](https://support.1password.com/share-items/)
  - [How to create, share, and manage vaults](https://support.1password.com/create-share-vaults-teams/)
- If you are unsure if a password or account should be shared or if users should have their own accounts, ask Jake.

## 🔑 Access and Permissions
- To check if you already have access to a 1Password license, go to the [login page](https://start.1password.com/signin?l=en). If it doesn't recommend your primary Dustin Engineers or DB2Civil email address, you might need a license to be assigned to you.
- Reach out to Jake for new licenses.
- If you have set and forgotten your master password, there's not a lot we can do on the admin side, so **DO NOT FORGET YOUR MASTER PASSWORD**.
  - Do not lose your recovery token. When you set your master password it should have given you the option to print it. Print it and keep it secret; keep it safe.
- Vaults and sharing are managed by role. If you believe there is a vault or an account that you should have access to via 1Password, reach out to the vault's administrator (or Jake).

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup
1. If you have not already, confirm your account in the email that was sent to you by 1Password. If the link has expired reach out to Jake and he will send you a new one.
2. [Choose a good account password.](https://support.1password.com/strong-account-password/)
3. Once you set your account password, it will give you an option to print your "[emergency kit](https://support.1password.com/emergency-kit/)". 
   - This sheet of paper is the only thing that will allow us to recover your account if you forget your master password, so print it! 
   - If you are not near a printer, save it as a PDF until you are, and then print it and delete the PDF. 
   - Keep it somewhere safe where you will not forget about it.
4. [Install the browser extension for your browser of choice.](https://support.1password.com/explore/browser/)
5. [Install the desktop application for your operating system.](https://support.1password.com/get-the-apps/) The apps are easy to use and make managing items within 1Password much easier.
6. If you have passwords saved to another manager (such as your browser or your phone), [import any business-related ones into 1Password](https://support.1password.com/import/) and delete them from your browser.
   - You're welcome to move all of your passwords over but personal passwords can live in your browser if you prefer.
   - If you have configured the extensions and apps correctly, your passwords and other information should autofill just like they do from your browser.
   - If they are not autofilling, reach out to Jake. This should make your life easier, not harder.
7. [Install the mobile app](https://support.1password.com/get-the-apps/) on your phone for password and sensitive data management on the go.
8. [Disable password management features in your browser.](https://support.1password.com/disable-browser-password-manager/)
9. [Change any passwords that have been involved in data leaks or that are reused across multiple sites.](https://support.1password.com/watchtower/) As an admin, I can see who's reusing passwords and identify who our security risks are. Don't think I won't call you out on it.
10. Pat yourself on the back. You're a security guru now!

## 🛡️ Licensing and Compliance
- Certain clients and vendors will require us to complete security audits before working with us.
- Security breaches and violations can happen to anyone, even to smaller companies like DE. It's much, much easier to fortify than it is to rebuild.
- Employees who are found to consistently and flagrantly violate security policies may be subject to discipline. Accidents happen. What's important is they're fixed.

## 🎓 Training and Support
- 1Password has an extensive support site with subjects on pretty much everything you can imagine. Search there to answer questions first.
- If you have a question about how we are using vaults, accessing 1Password or other accounts, or anything IT-related, reach out to Jake in the [it-help](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3Ae79d6b41437e4148bbc5cec536e0ba85%40thread.tacv2/it-help?groupId=7dd20eb7-eff1-4d7f-8a6f-189136f527ab&tenantId=29ab7786-7612-4498-bfd5-58adab8b3a0d) Teams chat.

## 😈 Troubleshooting and FAQs
- Once I have been asked a few questions frequently I will put them here.
