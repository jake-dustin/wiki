## Purpose

The purpose of this style guide is to ensure consistency and clarity in IT documentation across the organization. 
This guide provides guidelines for formatting, language use, and structure to help authors create clear and concise IT documents.

## Audience

IT documents should be accessible to all employees regardless of technical proficiency. 
The language should be clear and concise, avoiding technical jargon whenever possible. 
Any jargon or technical terms that are unavoidable should be clearly defined in the glossary.

## Document Structure

IT documents should follow a standard structure to ensure consistency and ease of navigation. 
All pages should have the following sections:

### General Structure

- **Title:** A descriptive title that clearly identifies the document's purpose.
- **Introduction/Overview:** A brief overview of the document's contents and objectives.
- **Users and Roles:** Who is impacted and/or eligible for a certain policy.
***
- **Body:** Sections specific to the document type.
***
- **Contact Information:** Who to contact in case of questions, edit requests, etc.
- **Related Documents and Additional Resources:** Anything that is relevant or helpful that didn't fit in the wiki page.
- **Edit History:** A history of changes made with dates and authors.

The body sections of the following page types might be structured like so:

### Programs and Systems Pages

These pages are for outlining policies and procedures around specific programs.
- **Policies and Guidelines:** Specific rules and regulations around using certain software and guidelines for best practices.
- **Access and Permissions:** Who can gain access, how to gain access, and permissions required for different users.
- **Installation and Setup:** Installation instructions (if any) and setup requirements and configuration.
- **Licensing and Compliance:** Licensing requirements and any relevant legal/regulatory standards.
- **Training and Support:** Resources on how to use a program.

### Policy Pages

- **Policy:** The main body of the document, including the policy statement or procedure.
- **Responsibilities:** A list of roles and responsibilities related to the policy or procedure.
- **Procedures:** Detailed steps or instructions for implementing the policy or procedure.

## Language and Tone

- Use clear and concise language, avoiding technical jargon whenever possible.
- Use active voice to make the document more engaging and easier to understand.
- Avoid using abbreviations or acronyms without first defining them.

## Formatting

- Use headings and subheadings to organize the document and improve readability.
- Use links to other pages instead of repeating information. Information should be stated once to avoid potential inaccuracies.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for lists of items or steps.
- Use tables and diagrams to illustrate complex information or relationships.
- Use consistent formatting for headings, lists, and other elements throughout the document.

## References and Citations

- Provide references or citations for any external sources or information used in the document.
- Follow a standard citation format (e.g., APA, MLA) for references.

## Review Process

- All IT documents should be reviewed by a designated reviewer (Jake, unless otherwise specified within a document) before publication.
- The purpose of the review process is to ensure that the document is accurate, complete, and compliant with relevant policies and procedures.

## Version Control

- Use a version control system to track revisions and updates to IT documents.
- Include the version history section in the document to track changes, including the date of each revision and the author.

## Accessibility and Transparency

- Ensure that IT documents are accessible to all employees, including those with disabilities.
- Use accessible document formats and provide alternative formats upon request.

## Glossary

- Include a glossary of terms used in the document to define technical terms and acronyms.
- The glossary should be located at the end of the document for easy reference.
